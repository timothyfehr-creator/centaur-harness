# Progress Ledger

Cross-work-package status for the Centaur harness — one short entry per work
package. See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md) for the
canonical plan and ordering.

## WP-1 — Bootstrap scaffold ✅ complete (commit `beb3daf`)

Created the smallest viable repo so verification could run: `scripts/verify.py`,
`tests/test_verify_modes.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`,
`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`,
`docs/COMMAND_SAFETY.md`.

## WP0.1 — Scaffold verification & CI ✅ complete

WP0.1's behavior was already delivered by the WP-1 bootstrap; this pass hardened
the tests, added this ledger, and ran CI for real.

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `python scripts/verify.py --mode scaffold` exits 0 | ✅ |
| `python scripts/verify.py` exits 0, defaults to scaffold | ✅ |
| unknown modes exit nonzero with a clear error | ✅ (exit 2, `unknown mode`) |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (5 passed) |
| CI runs scaffold-verify + pytest | ✅ (see run below) |
| existing checks preserved | ✅ |

- Tests hardened in commit `d349421` (draft/release assert the clear `unknown
  mode` error; scaffold asserts its `scaffold verification OK` success message).
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27730539855](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27730539855)
  on `924d260` (steps *Scaffold verification* and *Tests* both passed).
- Note: the local machine has `python3` (3.14) but no `python` binary; tests
  invoke via `sys.executable`, and CI provisions `python` via
  `actions/setup-python`.

## WP0.2 — Command safety & secret scan ✅ complete

Implemented `scripts/secret_scan.py` (a minimum gate, not an oracle), wired it into
CI, and flipped the command-safety docs from deferred to implemented.

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| bare `python scripts/secret_scan.py` exits 0 | ✅ (13 files at WP0.2, grows with the repo; fail-closed if git fails / 0 files) |
| safe fixture exits 0 | ✅ |
| unsafe fixture exits 1 (fake secret caught) | ✅ (masked, names the file) |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (30 passed) |
| CI runs the secret scan | ✅ (step before scaffold + tests) |
| no broad framework / new dependency added | ✅ (pure stdlib) |

- Scanner + fixtures + tests: `eae1595`; CI wiring + docs + tracked fixtures:
  `553f98a`; hardening per adversarial review (fail-closed, delimited-token
  placeholders, per-rule recall, UUID precision): `cbbe2c8`.
- CI action versions bumped to `checkout@v5` / `setup-python@v6` (Node-20
  deprecation warning cleared).
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27731991363](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27731991363)
  on `cbbe2c8` (Secret scan, Scaffold verification, Tests all passed).
- Note: fixture/test secrets are synthetic and prefix-split so GitHub push
  protection does not block the push.

## WP1.1 — Enforceable scenario schema ✅ complete

Made scenario YAML machine-validatable (structural only; sourcing is WP2.3). Chose
**PyYAML + a hand-rolled validator** (one new dependency: PyYAML) over
jsonschema/pydantic — the cross-field rules need custom code regardless.

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| valid fixtures + the real example pass | ✅ |
| each invalid fixture fails for its EXACT reason | ✅ (9 codes, one finding each) |
| schema_version / branches / ≥3 signposts / ≥1 falsifier / rationale-or-update / prob sum | ✅ |
| scenario validation wired into scaffold | ✅ (structural; fails closed without PyYAML) |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (46 passed) |
| existing checks preserved; no out-of-scope work | ✅ |

- Feature commit `ea9973e`: `scripts/validate_schemas.py`,
  `examples/ukraine_crimea_logistics/scenario.yaml` (ILLUSTRATIVE/unsourced),
  `schemas/scenario.schema.md`, valid/invalid fixtures + `tests/test_schema_validation.py`,
  scaffold hook in `verify.py`, `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest + PyYAML), CI step.
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27733665200](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27733665200)
  on `ea9973e` (Install deps, Secret scan, Schema validation, Scaffold verification,
  Tests all passed).
- Deferred within WP1.1 (flagged): `label`/`as_of_date` enforcement (WP3.2 / §6);
  tighter probability tolerance (backlog); other schemas (WP1.2). PyYAML is now a
  required dependency — scaffold **fails closed** without it.

## WP1.2 — Core schema skeletons ✅ complete

Generalized the validator to be **kind-aware** (agent / source / claim / event / turn)
while leaving the scenario validator and the scaffold/CI wiring byte-for-byte
unchanged. Flat declarative skeleton specs + a registry; one PROVISIONAL enum per kind
where natural, grounded in STANAG 2511 / ICD-203 + Kent / DIME / IR typology.

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| schemas exist + enforceable (5 kinds) | ✅ (`--kind`; flat declarative specs) |
| missing required fields fail | ✅ (`missing-schema-version` / `missing-field`) |
| invalid enum values fail | ✅ (`invalid-enum`; absent enum ⇒ `missing-field`) |
| wrong types fail | ✅ (`wrong-type`; e.g. `turn.number`) |
| valid fixtures pass | ✅ (5 valid + 13 single-fault invalid) |
| scaffold / CI stay green; no out-of-scope semantics | ✅ |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (64 passed) |

- Feature commit `dc9bb10`: `scripts/validate_schemas.py` (kind-aware),
  `schemas/{agent,source,claim,event,turn}.schema.md`, 18 synthetic fixtures +
  parametrized tests. `verify.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `requirements-dev.txt`
  unchanged.
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27735538268](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27735538268)
  on `dc9bb10` (Secret scan, Schema validation, Scaffold verification, Tests passed).
- Notes / deferred: enum **semantics** deferred (claim↔source resolution WP2.1, event
  semantics WP2.2, agent grounding WP5, turn ordering/replay WP7); enum values are
  PROVISIONAL. **No real instances** added — skeleton CI coverage rides on the `pytest`
  step, not the bare schema-validation step. Backlog: canonical filenames are plural
  (`agents.yaml`); a singular `agent.yaml` would currently infer scenario — harden when
  real instances land.

## WP2.1 — Source & claim registry validation ✅ complete

The first **evidence gate**: `factbase/sources.yaml` + `factbase/claims.yaml`, with
claim→source resolution and a source-tier rule. Two standalone validators reuse the
WP1.2 skeleton engine via a derived entry-spec; **scaffold/`verify.py` untouched**
(resolution is draft-mode/WP4 territory per CONSTITUTION §3).

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| source + claim registries exist + validate clean | ✅ (illustrative/synthetic) |
| a valid claim resolves to a valid source | ✅ |
| missing / unresolved source ref fails | ✅ (`missing-source-ref` / `unresolved-source-ref`) |
| missing claim id fails | ✅ (`missing-field`) |
| social-only top-confidence claim fails | ✅ (`confidence-tier-violation`) |
| scaffold + the 64 prior tests stay green; no ingestion | ✅ |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (82 passed) |

- **Vocab finalized** (user choice): `claim.confidence` = `CONFIRMED / LIKELY /
  UNCERTAIN / UNASSESSED` (intel evidential status). "CONFIRMED" in the plan == the
  implemented top-confidence value; the tier rule triggers on it.
- **Tier rule** = a `CONFIRMED` claim must cite ≥1 source of a **recognized non-SOCIAL
  tier** (OFFICIAL/MAINSTREAM) — fail-closed against missing/unknown tiers (review fix).
- Feature commit `a94d358`: `scripts/validate_sources.py`, `scripts/validate_claims.py`,
  `factbase/*.yaml` (synthetic), 13 registry fixtures + two test files, the
  `CLAIM_SPEC` enum migration, two CI steps.
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27843062841](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27843062841)
  on `a94d358` (Secret scan, Schema validation, Source/Claim registry validation,
  Scaffold verification, Tests all passed).
- **Deferred (named):** the §5 "label unsupported items ASSUMPTION/MODEL_OUTPUT/
  ILLUSTRATIVE" half is **not** enforced here — WP2.1 requires every *registry* claim
  to resolve; labeling unsourced *narrative* claims is WP3.2/WP4. `as_of_date` is
  accepted-but-unvalidated. Real sourcing of the scenario is WP2.3.

## WP2.2 — Event ledger validation ✅ complete

Extended the evidence chain: an `factbase/events.yaml` ledger where **events reference
claims** (resolution by claim-id, mirroring claims→sources). `validate_events.py` is a
structural twin of `validate_claims.py` minus the tier rule; `verify.py`/scaffold and
`validate_sources`/`validate_claims` untouched.

| Acceptance criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| event ledger exists + validates clean | ✅ (illustrative/synthetic) |
| a valid event resolves to claims | ✅ |
| missing / unresolved claim ref fails | ✅ (`missing-claim-ref` / `unresolved-claim-ref`) |
| event confidence + category validate | ✅ (`invalid-enum`; `confidence` reuses the claim vocab) |
| duplicate id fails | ✅ (`duplicate-id`) |
| 82 prior tests stay green; no ingestion | ✅ |
| `pytest` exits 0 | ✅ (94 passed) |

- **Vocab:** `event.confidence` = `CONFIRMED / LIKELY / UNCERTAIN / UNASSESSED` (reuses
  the claim vocab — user choice). **No confidence-consistency cross-rule** and no dead
  code for one (minimal — user choice).
- Feature commit `9f61447` (atomic): `scripts/validate_events.py`, `factbase/events.yaml`
  (synthetic), the `EVENT_SPEC` confidence migration + the 3 schema event fixtures +
  `event_invalid_confidence`, 8 registry fixtures + `tests/test_event_validation.py`, one
  CI step.
- **GitHub Actions:** ✅ success — run
  [27882984163](https://github.com/timothyfehr-creator/centaur-harness/actions/runs/27882984163)
  on `9f61447` (Secret scan, Schema validation, Source/Claim/Event registry validation,
  Scaffold verification, Tests all passed).
- **Deliberate invariant (flagged):** every event references ≥1 claim regardless of
  confidence — a likely future-relaxation point for raw/unsourced events. Note: factbase
  registry *structure* is enforced in CI by the resolution validators (each re-runs the
  skeleton on entries), not by the scenario-only bare `validate_schemas.py` step.

## Deferred (not started)

Source-or-label the Ukraine example (WP2.3), safety enforcement & output labels (WP3.x),
draft mode (WP4.1), release mode (WP8.2), and engine work.
